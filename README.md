# Diabetes Prediction App Using ML and Flask

## Overview

Welcome to the Diabetes Prediction App! In this project, I have explored the application of various Machine Learning models to predict diabetes based on features such as Fasting Sugar (FS) and Frequent Urination (FU). I have conducted thorough analysis and experimentation to achieve accurate predictions.

## Model Performance

I have the performance of four Machine Learning models:

1. *Logistic Regression*: Achieved a stellar accuracy of 100%.
2. *Support Vector Machine (SVM)*: Also achieved 100% accuracy.
3. *Linear Regression*: Impressed with a 100% accuracy score.
4. *K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)*: Maintained robust performance with a respectable 75% accuracy.

## Dataset Overview

The dataset comprises three crucial columns:

1. *Fasting Sugar (FS)*: An integer value representing the level of fasting sugar in the patient's blood.
2. *Frequent Urination (FU)*: A Boolean value indicating whether the patient experiences frequent urination.
3. *Diabetes*: Another Boolean value indicating whether the patient has been diagnosed with diabetes. This serves as the target variable for prediction.

## Preprocessing Techniques

In my project, I utilized various preprocessing techniques to enhance model performance:

- *One-Hot-Encoding*: Implemented in KNN and SVM to handle categorical features like "Frequent Urination".
- *MinMaxScaler*: Applied to normalize numerical features, enhancing the performance of KNN.

## Web Application

I have developed a user-friendly web application using Flask, leveraging the power of Logistic Regression for seamless diabetes prediction.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

In my analysis, I have conducted various visualizations using matplotlib and seaborn libraries, providing deeper insights into the dataset.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the necessary dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt.
3. Explore the Jupyter notebooks in the Notebooks directory for EDA and model evaluation.
4. Run the Flask web application from the WebApp directory using python app.py.
5. Have fun exploring and contributing to the project!
